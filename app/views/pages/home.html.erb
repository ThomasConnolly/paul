    <p><strong>Jean Silver </strong>is asking for donations for the USO "Operation Phone Home." For $15 a trooper stationed far from home can make 300 minutes of calls. This is the fifth years Jean has been trumpeting this cause. She raised $3,000 last year!<p>

    <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again every Saturday starting November 14.</p>
    <h1>Big Yard Sale Next Weekend</h1>
    <p>This will be a preview of our Farmers' Market, which opens Nov. 14, but with loads of treasures from our neighbors' garages and attics. There's plenty of parking and still time to sign up for a table by calling the office between 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. That's 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday, Oct. 31.</p><br>

<p>"That means that the vestry will be asking many of us to become more involved than we currently are," he said.</p>
