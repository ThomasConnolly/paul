        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>Your pledge is not a promissory note, contract or any other kind of legal document that binds you. It's
          merely a good-faith estimate of what you plan to donate to St. Paul's. It is enormously helpful for your
          church leaders in planning the church budget. If your circumstances change or for any other reason you wish to
          amend or remove your pledge you may do so at any time, by logging in and clicking on the "Update your pledge"
          button on the home page. </p>
        <p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
