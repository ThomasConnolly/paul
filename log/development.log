            <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at a shelter in the
              Dominican Republic for the last 18 years. The <em>Albergue el Buen Samaritano</em> in San
              Francisco de Macoris, serves a hundred children who would be on the street were it not for the
              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
              affection, above all.</p>

                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
