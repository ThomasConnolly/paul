        <h1>The Vestry </h1>
          <p> St. Paul's and other Episcopal churches rely on lay persons to engage in a mutual ministry with the ordained clergy to tend to the affairs, both spiritual and temporal, of the parish.</p>  
          <p>Vestry meetings are open to all parishioners, and are usually held the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. Notice of the meeting and its agenda are posted a week or so before the meeting.</p>
          <p>Two wardens and the treasurer along with the priest-in-charge comprise the executive committee of the vestry, and they set the agenda. The priest is a member of the vestry by virtue of his office.</p>
          <p>Our senior warden is Richard Breithhaupt. The junior warden is Don Anderson. The treasurer is Dave Abernethy.</p>
          <p>Other members of the vestry are Judy Allen, Charlene Connolly, Alan Cragg, Dick Emerson, Yvon Hive, Peter Lund, Lee Perry, Darlene Shoemaker, and Bev Whiteman.</p>
          <p>The vestry came to be called that because parish leadership typically met in the space used by priests to change into vestments. It is also called the Congregational Council.
          </p>
          <p>It is appropriate and encouraged that anyone in the parish who has ideas or suggestions for the betterment of the congregation bring these concerns to a vestry person.</p>

        <h2>The rector</h2>
          <p><strong><em>What's a rector?</em></strong></p>
          <p>Rector is an "agent noun," such as actor and inventor. These are nouns formed from the action verb. In the case of rector, the verb is from the Latin, "regere," meaning "to rule." Historically a rector was a ruler or governor with temporal powers.</p>
          <p>St. Paul's is led by a priest-in-charge, who for all intents and purposes, is our rector. The vestry, with permission of our bishop, the Rt. Rev. Dabney Smith, has decided to celebrate our Jubilee! year which will culminate with a feast in January 2018, with our priest-in-charge, Fr. Bill.</p>
          <p>The vestry has now turned its attention to calling a rector who will lead us into the future.</p>
