      <h2 class="mt-3">Meet our new bishop</h2>
      <p>Following a centuries-old tradition of announcing his presence by banging on the cathedral door, 
      our new bishop was formally invested and seated Saturday, Jan. 7. The Right Rev. Dr. Douglas Scharf has 
      returned to the diocese where he was raised and is well known. He was elected at a special convention 
      April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in Sarasota. He became the sixth 
      bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retired. Although 
      all the official steps were already taken (i.e., the paperwork done), Hurricane Ian and Covid interfered 
      with the ceremonial seating. That took place at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, in St. Petersburg  
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born 
      in New York and from age 2 raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
      parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
      Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
