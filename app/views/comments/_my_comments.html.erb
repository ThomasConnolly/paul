Hello Tom,

The form's url is what is triggering the routes to send it to a particular controller and action. If you have the form set to something like <%#= form_with model: [commentable, comment], .... do |f| %> then it will go to the candidates comments controller or whichever applicable. I believe if you have model: comment instead (if you're using form_with, then it should go to the comments controller. Also, you can override the url parameter in the form to handle this as well with something like <%#= form_with model: [commentable, comment], url: comments_path .... do |f| %>
