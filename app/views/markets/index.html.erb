     <h1>About the Saint Paul's Farmers' Market</h1><h2>(Market season is from November 14 to next April; open 8 a.m. to noon) </h2>
  
        <p>The market is a ministry of goodwill, hospitality, rejoicing and gratitude, 
        as we offer our neighbors not just acceptance, but a "glad you're here" 
        and an opportunity to enjoy being with family, friends and pets as all enjoy together 
        the goodness of God's creation, from the beautiful outdoors and the music of church bells 
        to food to flowers to the creativity which is God's gift to humankind. </p>
        <p>Our market is a wonderful outreach and gift to our community, that says, "God's place is a good place to be."  </p><p>
        It is also an outreach to vendors that helps them make a better living for themselves and their families.
        The market and its related activities also bring very significant economic benefit to St. Paul's, although 
        the charge for renting a vendor space is very, very reasonable.  We want them to do well.</p>
         <p>We try very hard to retain the farmers' market image that we value such as by limiting crafts, etc. 
         We encourage civic organizations with free space, like the Humane Society, the Shelter for Abused Women, The Salvation Army, to make us aware of their services. </p> 
         <p>That especially serves to remind us of our community service role here at St. Paul's.</p>
