  <p><strong>Steps to add books to the library website:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Find your book.</strong></p>
  <p>Launch MarcEdit and click on black box, Z39.50/SRU Client. Here are the settings: Retrieve Unicode, character set UTF8. See below for selecting the database.</p>
  <p>
  Enter title in search box and click the green arrow. If the book is found, the title will appear in the box. Double click the listing in that box and preview the marc record. Call out the Dewey number to your co-worker, who will make a note of it.</p>
  <p>
  If the book is not found using the title, try by author. Scroll through the list to find the correct title. Or you can search by isbn. If this fails, put the book aside for later and go to the next one.</p>
  <p class=text-center><b>Book cant' be found?</b></p>
  <p> 
  In the event the book is not found in the Library of Congress, click "Select Database" and pick another library. If the book is about theology or religion, a good choice for a database is Oxford University. Click the "Select Database" in options box, click on the alternate database and then click "select resource." You selection will now show under the "Query Database" above the search box. If this fails, go to Google and enter the title, and gather the information for the book there. If that fails, just take the info from the book itself and add a reasonable Dewey number (see the book on how to catalog).</p>
  <p><strong>2. Save your book</strong></p>
  <p>
  When you are in the "View MARC Record" box, you will see a line, "Save File:" Click on the folder icon and give your file this name: "books27June" without quotes and using the appropriate date. The machine will append the extension .mrc automatically.</p>
  <p>
  Make sure there's a check in the "Append" box, then click on "Download Record," upper left. The record is now saved to the file you named, on the desktop. Repeat the process until you're finished with the number of books you are cataloguing that session. Make sure "append" is checked or you will overwrite all the work you have done.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Create a csv file of your books</strong></p>
  <p>In the MarcEdit program, click on "Export Tab Delimited." Migrate to the *.mrc file you just created with all the books, and give it the same name you gave the .mrc file, i.e., books27June. This file will have an extension of .csv (comma separated value). In the box below where you just named it, select comma delimited. Now hit "next" and click "Normalized field data" and click on "settings" in the lower right corner. Select "load settings and click marcSettings.txt" Then click the "Export" button. A alert will tell you the file has been saved on the desktop. Exit MarcEdit.
  <p><strong>4. Edit your csv file</strong></p>
  <p>Edit the file in Notebook+ or other text editor. First change the headers: 082 to dewey, 100 to author, 245 to title, 650 to subject, and 020 to isbn.</p>
  <p>Next, edit each line. If there's no name in the author field, use the name that follows the title. It might say something like "edited by William James." In that case, put James, William (editor) in the author box. In the title field, remove the secondary information, usually following a forward slash. We want only the title in this field. You can pretty much leave the subject field alone, even if it's empty.</p> 
  <p>Sometimes there will be multiple isbn listings. just remove all but one. Remove things like ":(dollar)35.00 and (pbk.). Just keep the 10- or 13-digit number.</p>
  <p>Finally, we want only the three-digit dewey call number and two digits after the period. If there are no digits after the dot, delete the dot. Save the file.</p>
  <p>N.B. In order to import the books into our website, each book must have an author and a title. Without something in those fields, the import will fail.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Import the csv file into our website</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Make a note of this number (write it down, because it will change after the next step): <%= @last_book %> </strong></p>
  
  <p>Just click the box "Choose File" and click on the file with the name you gave it, such as "books27June.csv." Then click "upload books."</p>
            <h4>Import books from a csv file</h4>
            <%= bootstrap_form_for @import, url: import_books_path, multipart: true do |f|%>
            <%= f.alert_message "Please fix the errors below." %>
            <%= f.file_field :file %><br>
            <%= f.submit  "Upload books" %>
            <% end %>
  <p><strong>6. Generate a file for printing the labels</strong></p>
  <p>Click on <%= link_to "CSV", books_admin_path(format: "csv") %> and it will generate a three-column csv file preview.</p>
  
  <p>First, change the Field type of the dewey column to "Text" from "Standard" and click OK. (You're doing this to preserve the deweys that start with zero. Spreadsheets always think they're dealing with integers). Click OK and the spreadsheet will open fully</p>
  <p>Then do that step again. Click on "dewey" and the entire column should highlight. Go to "format" and select "text."</p>
  <p>Now delete all the rows with the id of 1 through and including the number you wrote down. (You don't want to print labels you've already printed). Save this file. The machine will give it the name "bookLabels-2017-06-27.csv (today's date)."
  <p><strong>7. Print the labels</strong></p>
  <p>Click on the Dyno icon on the Windows desktop.
