      <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again in November.</p><br>
