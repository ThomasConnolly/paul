<p>Sunday School life at Saint Paul's brings our children into classes in Serson Hall. At 10 a.m. there is a year-around study of the Episcopal Church, its seasons, and the catechism.</p>
<p>Children join their families in church for Holy Communion after Sunday School.</p>
<p>The children from our 5:30 p.m. Creole Holy Name of Jesus congregation come to Sunday School at 5:45 p.m. in Serson Hall for classroom activities and learning about Jesus and the Episcopal Church.</p>
