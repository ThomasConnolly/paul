        <h1>Pay your pledge on line</h1>
     <p>There are a couple ways for you to simplify paying your pledge. The simplist way is to have your bank send a check to St. Paul's on a schedule you set.</p>
     <p>Most banks offer this service without charge, and it's easy to set up. Just go on line with your bank and search for "bill pay" or other words to that effect.</p>
     <p>Paying on line with a credit or debit card is easy to set up, too.
