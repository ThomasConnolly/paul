<h1>Vestry </h1>


  <p> Saint Paul's and other Episcopal churches rely on lay persons to engage in a mutual ministry with the ordained clergy to tend to the affairs, both spiritual and temporal, of the parish.</p>  
  <p>Vestry meetings are open to all parishioners, and are usually held the last Wednesday of the month at 6:30 p.m. Notice of the meeting and its agenda are posted a week or so before the meeting.</p>
  <p>Two wardens and the treasurer along with the priest-in-charge comprise the executive committee of the vestry, and they set the agenda. The priest is a member of the vestry by virtue of his office.</p>
  <p>Our senior warden is Richard Breithhaupt. The junior warden is Van Geoghegan. </p>
  <p>Other members of the vestry are Don Anderson, Hal Brundage, Charlene Connolly, Alan Cragg, Yvon Hive, Barb Kling, Patti Loree, Judy Martin, Adrienne McGrain and Bev Whiteman.</p>
  <p>It is appropriate and encouraged that anyone in the parish who has ideas or suggestions for the betterment of the congregation bring these concerns to a vestry person.</p>
