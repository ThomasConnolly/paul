    <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again in November.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Sabine is hoping </strong> to repeat her very successful book drive of last year as she launches her new drive to benefit the kids at Pinecrest Elementary School. Most of the children at the Immokalee school come from homes where books are in short supply, a fact that Sabine knows because her mom, Pam, teaches there. There's a tub in Trinity Hall to deposit age-appropriate books. Cash, checks and Barnes & Noble gift cards also will be appreciated. </p><br>
