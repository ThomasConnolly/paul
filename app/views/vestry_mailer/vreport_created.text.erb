The vreports page is for vestry members only, and it is accessed by putting a "/vreports" after the .org in the address line. It is here where you are expected to file your report on your specific ministry and the work your team has done or plans to do.
          
Reports are due one week before the next scheduled vestry meeting (April 21). This will give your fellow vestry persons time to have their questions and concerns addressed in the comments section before the meeting.
