<h2>Presiding bishop celebrates diocese</h2>
    <p>Presiding Bishop Michael Curry was keynote speaker and primary celebrant of a three-hour Eucharist Friday, the highlights to the first of a two-day annual convention of church business and workshops. In addition to our delegates, pictured above, a busload of St. Paul's folks got to hear the bishop, best known for his sermon at the royal wedding and for branding our church as "the Episcopal branch of the Jesus Movement." Click below to see a recording of his talk and the mass.</p>

    <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at
      a shelter in the Dom:inican Republic for the last 17 years. The
      <em>Albergue el Buen Samaritano</em> in San Francisco de Macoris, serves
      about a hundred children who would be on the street were it not for the
      shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills
      and get lots of love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives.
      It is a ministry of love and affection, above all.</p>

    <p>Dr. Susan Wilson, an English family physician, is full of energy and zeal
      for the Lord. She founded <em>Tumaini </em>(the word means "hope") <em>
      Fund </em> to put her faith to work in the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of
      Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for thousands of
      children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. She spoke at both services
      on Sunday, March 11, and collected money and 34 dresses made by the ladies
      of our church, the ECW (Episcopal Church Women).</p>
    <p>Parishioners Mike Moore and Roger Conant are directors for the fund in
      the United States.</p>
