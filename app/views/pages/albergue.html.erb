    <h1>Naples Episcopalians support these children</h1>
 
    <p>Saint Paul's has an annual sponsorship drive, supplemented by gifts from the vestry, the ECW, Gift Shop and others, to support the children at the albergue infantil el buen samaritano (children's shelter of the Good Samaritan). </p>
    <p>The ministry was begun in 2001 when representatives of the churches in Naples, both lay and ordained, visited the Dominican Republic to make the "companion diocese" meaningful.</p>
    <p>This video features the Rev. Hipolito Fernandez Reina explaining the ministry from his vantage of being priest-in-charge of the shelter. He is now a priest in our diocese.</p>
    <p><em>Suggestion: </em> turn down your volume and click the "cc" button to read what Fr. Hipolito is saying. The audio is filled with the voices of children at play.</p>
