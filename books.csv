"Purpose Driven Life","Warren, Rick","Christianity","248.4","9780310205715","Description of the book in so many words (actually can be pretty long, as it's a text field, and not a string, which is limited to 256 characters, I think. I think Twitter limits to the size of a string, too, and that, I believe, is 256. Anyway, this is unlimited in its length, so I'm interested in seeing just how good a job it does in the Rails app. Using Rails 5.1 for this, and hoping for a good result. Anyway, I think this is quite enough text for a book description. Any more and I'd be concerned about copyright laws."
