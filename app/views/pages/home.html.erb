  <h1> Home of the friendly Farmers&rsquo; Market </h1>
    <%= image_tag("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/saintpaulsnaplesorg/logos/FarmMktLogo.png", width:"47%", class: "floatleft") %>
    <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again every Saturday until next April.</p>
    <p>In addition to the vendors of produce and other tasty treats, the market hosts several artisans displaying their art and craft pieces. Also, our gift shop is open, and the Unique Boutique does a brisk business in gently used fine clothing for the ladies.</p> <br>
