        <h3>This is an invitation to take the parish survey</h3>
            <p>We are asking each parishioner to tell us what they think is important as we begin the search for a new rector, and this is your invitation to respond. The button below is a link to the survey.</p>
            <p>Your answers are very important for the future of St. Paul's. Please set aside some time to take the survey and prayerfully consider each question before you answer. All responses are anonymous and no identifying information will be collected with this survey. Please complete this survey by February 15, 2018.</p>
            <p>If you are a snowbird we want your input too, as you are an integral part of St. Paul's!</p>


            <p>Thanks very much!</p>
            <p>Parish search committee</p>
