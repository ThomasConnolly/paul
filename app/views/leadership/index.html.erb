        <p>Fr. Tom joined St. Paul’s on Nov. 1, 2018, after 15 years as rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Plant
          City, FL. He was installed as rector on Jan. 6, 2019.</p>
        <p> He has lived all but six years of his life in his native state, Florida. He grew up in Jacksonville the
          younger of two children. He earned a bachelor of design degree from the College of Fine Arts at the University
          of Florida. During his years at UF, he was deeply involved at the Chapel of the Incarnation, where he
          discerned his call to the priesthood and met and married his wife, Quincey.</p>
        <p>He attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, just north of Chicago. There he received his
          master of divinity degree and served as the seminary equivalent of class president, and acquired a reputation
          as a mediator and trusted bridge builder between people of disparate viewpoints.</p>
        <p>After seminary Fr. Tom served churches in Albany, Ga, and Pensacola before being called as rector at St.
          Peter's. As rector there he brought a sense of stability and health, with the areas of buildings and grounds,
          lay ministry, outreach and administration being particularly strengthened.</p>
        <p>In 2012, Fr. Thoeni earned his doctor of ministry in a joint program between Seabury-Western Theological
          Seminary and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif. </p>
        <p class="mb-5">He and Quincey have two sons in college.</p>

      <h1>The Vestry </h1>
      <p> St. Paul's and other Episcopal churches rely on lay persons to engage in a mutual ministry with the ordained
        clergy to tend to the affairs, both spiritual and temporal, of the parish.</p>
      <p>Vestry meetings are open to all parishioners, and are usually held the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m.
        Notice of the meeting and its agenda are posted a week or so before the meeting.</p>
      <p>Two wardens and the treasurer along with the rector comprise the executive committee of the vestry, and they
        set the agenda. The rector is a member of the vestry by virtue of his office.</p>
      <p>Our senior warden is Peter Lund. The junior warden is Joyce Cashin. The treasurer is Nora Broszeit.</p>
      <p>Other members of the vestry are Dave Abernethy, Judy Allen, Don Anderson, Richard Breithaupt, Steve Carnell,
        Van Geohegan, Judy Martin, and Rich Shea.</p>
      <p>The vestry came to be called that because parish leadership typically met in the space used by priests to
        change into vestments. It is also called the congregational council.
      </p>
      <p>It is appropriate and encouraged that anyone in the parish who has ideas or suggestions for the betterment of
        the congregation should bring these concerns to the rector or to any other member of the vestry.</p>
