  <h1> Home of the friendly Farmers&rsquo; Market </h1>
  <h3> Record crowd on opening day last Saturday</h3>
    <%= image_tag("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/saintpaulsnaplesorg/logos/FarmMktLogo.png", width:"47%", class: "floatleft") %>
    <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again every Saturday until next April.</p>
    <p>In addition to the vendors of produce and other tasty treats, the market hosts several artisans displaying their art and craft pieces. Also, our gift shop is open, and the Unique Boutique does a brisk business in gently used fine clothing for the ladies.</p> <br>
    <h3>Blessing of the Animals Nov. 28 at the Farmers' Market</h3>
    <p>We always wait for the market to open, when our friends and neighbors from the North are here, to commemorate the feast of St. Francis in the blessing of the animals.</p>
    <p>Bring your pets (leashed or caged, as appropriate) for the 10 a.m. ceremony on the lawn between the church and Davis Boulevard.</p>

<p>The <strong>USO Basket Raffle </strong>was a great success.  This from Jean Silver: "Thank you to all those at St. Paul's who helped make the Basket Raffle possible.  Starting with tickets and mailing, designing and filling the baskets, and ending with the announcement of the winners.
God bless you all, and God bless our troops."<p>

<p><strong>Darrell G. Hayes,</strong> son of Dave Hayes and step-son of Sheila Hayes, was awarded the Bishopâ€™s Cross from The Rt. Rev. Andrew Dietsche, Sixteenth Bishop of New York at their recent diocesean convention.</p>
<%= image_tag("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/saintpaulsnaplesorg/darrellHayes.jpg", width: "40%", class: "floatright") %>
<p>Darrell, a retired NYPD sergeant, was honored for his work as Staten Island Disaster Response coordinator for the Episcopal diocese, particularly for his actions before and following the devastating Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>The storm caused great destruction on the island. Darrell coordinated the efforts of 3,000 volunteers of all faiths and charities to reconstruct uninhabitable housing. Those recovery efforts are nearing an end, and according to Stephen Harding, the Diocese Disaster Response Coordinator, "Darrell was the indispensible core that made it all work."</p>
