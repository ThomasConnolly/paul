      <h1>The Vestry </h1>
      <p> St. Paul's and other Episcopal churches rely on lay persons to engage in a mutual ministry with the ordained clergy to tend to the affairs, both spiritual and temporal, of the parish.</p>
      <p>Vestry meetings are open to all parishioners, and are usually held the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. Notice of the meeting and its agenda are posted a week or so before the meeting.</p>
      <p>Two wardens and the treasurer along with the rector comprise the executive committee of the vestry, and they set the agenda. The rector is a member of the vestry by virtue of his office.</p>
      <p>Our senior warden is Charlene Connolly. The junior warden is Don Anderson. The treasurer is Dave Abernethy.</p>
      <p>Other members of the vestry are Judy Allen, Joyce Cashin, Dick Emerson, Van Geohegan, Yvon Hive, and Lee Perry.</p>
      <p>The vestry came to be called that because parish leadership typically met in the space used by priests to change into vestments. It is also called the congregational council.
      </p>
      <p>It is appropriate and encouraged that anyone in the parish who has ideas or suggestions for the betterment of the congregation should bring these concerns to a member of the vestry.</p>
