      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was
        elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He
        will become the sixth bishop of the diocese when Bishop Dabney Smith retires, later this year.
      </p>
      <p>Fr. Scharf was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” Fr. Doug said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida when Bishop Dabney Smith retires, later this year.
      </p>
      <p>The newest, and at age 43 probably the youngest bishop in the Episcopal Church in America, was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida when Bishop Dabney Smith retires, later this year.
      </p>
      <p>The newest, and at age 43 probably the youngest bishop in the Episcopal Church in America, was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida when Bishop Dabney Smith retires, later this year.
      </p>
      <p>The newest, and at age 43 probably the youngest bishop in the Episcopal Church in America, was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>This is a series of videos, readings and small-group discussions about race. This is highly
        recommended if you have questions about "critical race theory," a topic needlessly politicized. To
        watch an introduction, <%= link_to "click here. " , "https://www.episcopalchurch.org/sacred-ground/" %></p>
        <p>Interested in pursuing <em>Sacred Ground</em> further? As in participating in a small-group study? Contact

            <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at a shelter in the
              Dominican Republic for the last 18 years. The <em>Albergue el Buen Samaritano</em> in San
              Francisco de Macoris, serves a hundred children who would be on the street were it not for the
              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
              affection, above all.</p>

              <p>Dr. Susan Wilson, an English family physician, is full of energy and zealfor the Lord. She
                founded <em>Tumaini </em>(the word means "hope") <em> Fund </em> to put her faith to work in
                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
                contributions, the ladies of our church, the ECW (Episcopal Church Women) have sewn numerous
                dresses, as seen here with Dr. Wilson.</p>
              <p>Parishioners Mike Moore and Roger Conant are directors for the fund in the United States.

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and

                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

            <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at a shelter in the

              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
              affection, above all.</p>

                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
                contributions, the ladies of our church, the ECW (Episcopal Church Women) have sewn numerous
                dresses, as seen here with Dr. Wilson.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
                contributions, the ladies of our church, the ECW (Episcopal Church Women) have sewn numerous
                dresses, as seen here with Dr. Wilson.</p>
              <p>Parishioners Mike Moore and Roger Conant are directors for the fund in the United States.

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He will become the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retires.
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
        parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
        Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-3">Meet our new bishop</h2>
      <p>
        The Right Rev. Dr. Doug Scharf has returned to the diocese where he was born and raised 
        and is well known. He was elected at a special convention April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in
        Sarasota. He became the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retired. Although 
        all the official steps were already taken (i.e., the paperwork done), Hurricane Ian and Covid interfered with the ceremonial seating. 
        Thus, an "investiture and seating" of the bishop will take place Saturday, Jan. 7, 2023, at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, in St. Petersburg.  
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born and raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several

      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>

            <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at a shelter in the
              Dominican Republic for the last 18 years. The <em>Albergue el Buen Samaritano</em> in San
              Francisco de Macoris, serves a hundred children who would be on the street were it not for the
              shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of
              love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
              affection, above all.</p>

              <p>Dr. Susan Wilson, an English family physician, is full of energy and zealfor the Lord. She
                founded <em>Tumaini </em>(the word means "hope") <em> Fund </em> to put her faith to work in
                the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
                thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
                contributions, the ladies of our church, the ECW (Episcopal Church Women) have sewn numerous
                dresses, as seen here with Dr. Wilson.</p>
              <p>Parishioners Mike Moore and Roger Conant are directors for the fund in the United States.

      <h2 class="mt-3">Meet our new bishop</h2>
      <p>Following a centuries-old tradition of announcing his presence by banging on the cathedral door, 
      our new bishop was formally invested and seated Saturday, Jan. 7. The Right Rev. Dr. Douglas Scharf has 
      returned to the diocese where he was raised and is well known. He was elected at a special convention 
      April 2 as our bishop coadjuter and was ordained as bishop September 24 in Sarasota. He became the sixth 
      bishop of the Diocese of Southwest Florida on Dec. 10, when Bishop Dabney Smith retired. Although 
      all the official steps were already taken (i.e., the paperwork done), Hurricane Ian and Covid interfered 
      with the ceremonial seating. That took place at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, in St. Petersburg  
      </p>
      <p>The newest&mdash;and at age 43 probably the youngest&mdash;bishop in the Episcopal Church in America was born 
      in New York and from age 2 raised in Ft. Myers, where his father was an Episcopal priest. He served several
      parishes in the Diocese of Southwest Florida before moving to Palm Beach County to become rector of Good
      Shepherd in Tequesta.</p>
      <p>"There are few moments when a priest is speechless, but this is one of them. I have been so humbled and honored
        to have been a part of this journey with you all and to be elected, I am truly overwhelmed. I feel the presence
        of God’s grace in this moment,” he said when he received the news of his election via a phone call from
        Bishop Smith. The assembly reacted with a joyful applause.</p>
