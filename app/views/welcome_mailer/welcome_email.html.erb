    <h3>Hello <%= @user.first_name.titleize %>, </h3>
    <p>
      This is an introduction to the new Saint Paul's website! </p>
    <p>
      Until now, our website has been useful for those looking for a church, but not so useful for our own parishioners. we're hoping to change the second part of that by inviting you to participate in this "social media."</p>
      
         <%= render 'vestry1' if @user.vestry? %>
       
    <p> 
      A members-only "Family Ties" page is is a place for you to keep in touch during the summertime diaspora, and share news and information while back home in Naples. If you need a ride to church, or want to wish someone a happy birthday or add someone to the parish prayer list, Family Ties will be the place to do it.</p>
     
    <p>
      <strong>How to get in</strong> </p>
    <p>
      <%= link_to "Clicking here", "http://www.saintpaulsnaples.org" %> will take you to the home page. From there, click the "Member sign in" at upper right. </p>
    <p>
      Once logged in you can start working on strengthening "family ties" with fellow parishioners or update your picture and profile. </p>
