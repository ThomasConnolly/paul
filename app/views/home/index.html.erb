          <p>Dr. Susan Wilson, an English family physician, is full of energy and zealfor the Lord. She
            founded <em>Tumaini </em>(the word means "hope") <em> Fund </em> to put her faith to work in
            the AIDS-ravaged Kagera region of Northwest Tanzania. There she established an orphanage for
            thousands of children who lost their moms and dads to AIDS. In addition to monitary
            contributions, the women of our church have sewn numerous
            dresses, as seen here with Dr. Wilson.</p>
          <p>Parishioners Mike Moore and Roger Conant are directors for the fund in the United States.
