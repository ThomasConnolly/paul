    <h2> A Facebook-like feature for members of our church family</h2>
      <p><strong>How is it like Facebook?</strong> It's a social medium.</p>
      <p><strong>How is it not like Facebook?</strong>  We are a small community, and as Christians we strive to love one another and to share the goodness of God's creation. Political and controversial posts tend to polarize; totally opposite of why this feature is on our website. Please respect this sentiment.</p>

<h2>About Communion</h2>
<p>Our unity begins at the Lord's table, where we partake of the body and blood of Jesus. It continues in our homes and the marketplace as we commune with one another.</p>
  <h2> Tell your story</h2>
<p>Don't let your fellow parishioners learn at your funeral that they had something in common with you!</p>
<p>Click here for  a questionnaire, of sorts, that you can use to introduce your deeper self. You can edit your profile from time to time as you wish.</p><span class="pull-right"> <%= link_to "About Me", edit_profile_path(current_user.profile(params[:id])), class: 'btn btn-success' %></span><br>
  <h2>Life's Events</h2>

  <h3>We're praying for...</h3>
    <p>Link to parish prayer list and accept readers' input. This page will be seen only by those who are logged in as church members. We will have three levels of authorization: administrators, who can create, edit and delete everything, is the top level. The second is member and this will have two "permissions categories": restricted and full. The third level is "guest," who can view the library page and search for books, for example. Guests will not be able to see this sharing page.</p>
