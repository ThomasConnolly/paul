This is an invitation to take a parish survey.

We are asking each parishioner to tell us what they think is important as we begin the search for a new rector, and this is your invitation to respond.

Your answers are very important for the future of St. Paul's. Please set aside some time to take the survey and prayerfully consider each question before you answer. All responses are anonymous and no identifying information will be collected with this survey. Please complete this survey by February 15, 2018.

If you are a snowbird we want your input, too, as you are an integral part of St. Paul's!

To take the survey, follow this link: <%= @url %>.

  Thanks very much!
  Parish search committee
