        <h1>The Vestry </h1>
          <p> St. Paul's and other Episcopal churches rely on lay persons to engage in a mutual ministry with the ordained clergy to tend to the affairs, both spiritual and temporal, of the parish.</p>
          <p>Vestry meetings are open to all parishioners, and are usually held the third Thursday of the month at 6:30 p.m. Notice of the meeting and its agenda are posted a week or so before the meeting.</p>
          <p>Two wardens and the treasurer along with the priest-in-charge comprise the executive committee of the vestry, and they set the agenda. The priest is a member of the vestry by virtue of his office.</p>
          <p>Our senior warden is Richard Breithhaupt. The junior warden is Don Anderson. The treasurer is Dave Abernethy.</p>
          <p>Other members of the vestry are Judy Allen, Charlene Connolly, Alan Cragg, Dick Emerson, Yvon Hive, Peter Lund, Lee Perry, Darlene Shoemaker, and Bev Whiteman.</p>
          <p>The vestry came to be called that because parish leadership typically met in the space used by priests to change into vestments. It is also called the Congregational Council.
          </p>
          <p>It is appropriate and encouraged that anyone in the parish who has ideas or suggestions for the betterment of the congregation bring these concerns to a vestry person.</p>
