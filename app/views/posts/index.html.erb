        <h2> A Facebook-like feature for our church family</h2>
          <p><strong>How is it like Facebook?</strong> It's a social medium.</p>
          <p><strong>How is it not like Facebook?</strong>  We are a small community, and as
          Christians we strive to love one another and to share the goodness of God's creation.
          Political and controversial posts tend to polarize; totally opposite of why this
          feature is on our website. Please respect this sentiment.</p>

      <h2>About Family Ties</h2>
        <p>Our unity as family begins with our baptism and is strengthened at the Lord's table, where we partake of the body and blood of Jesus. It continues in our homes and the marketplace as we commune with one another. Family ties are strengthened when we interact with each other.</p>
