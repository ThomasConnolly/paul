      <p>It's Jubilee! Let's celebrate the gifts God has gathered together in our Church!</p>

<p>To celebrate Jubilee! in the month of May, we're going  present our works at the Offertory this Sunday, May 28.</p>
<p>What would you write? Think of a time when you were a God-bearer to somebody, when you went out of your way to help someone. When did you extend yourself on behalf of someone else? These acts don't have to be epic in scale or heroic. We were created to do good works. Tell us in a phrase or sentence what you've been doing. Still stuck? Did you wipe a tear from a grandchild's face or allow someone to enter your lane? Good work! God's work!</p>
