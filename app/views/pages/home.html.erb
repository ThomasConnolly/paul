  <h1> Home of the friendly Farmers&rsquo; Market </h1>
  <h3> Opening Day Nov. 14 to feature Christmas bazaar</h3>
    <%= image_tag("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/saintpaulsnaplesorg/logos/FarmMktLogo.png", width:"47%", class: "floatleft") %>
    <p>This is the church where the great tradition of a farmers&rsquo; market flourishes. Each Saturday morning during "the season," November through April, hundreds of neighbors gather to stroll and shop for fresh produce, works of art, books and bagels. Thanks to our many volunteers who work hard behind the scenes to prepare for this big friendly block party; and thanks too to our patrons. We will see you again every Saturday starting November 14.</p>
    <p>Opening day will feature the Annual Bazaar in Trinity Hall, our parish activities center. There you will find Christmas items, gift items and a raffle of many wonderful gifts, benefit of the USO (see Update, at right). The Unique Boutique and Gift Shop also will be open Nov. 14.</p> <br>
