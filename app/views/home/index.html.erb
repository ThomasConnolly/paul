              <p>Episcopalians of the Naples Deanery have been supporting the children at a shelter in the Dominican Republic for the last 18 years. The <em>Albergue el Buen Samaritano</em> in San Francisco de Macoris, serves a hundred children who would be on the street were it not for the shelter. The kids arrive for breakfast, learn their abcs and social skills and get lots of love that may otherwise be missing in their young lives. It is a ministry of love and
              affection, above all.</p>
