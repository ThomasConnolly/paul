        <p>Bishop Dabney Smith put the wheels in motion Oct. 17, at this year's annual convention, for the selection of his
          replacement. He asked the convention to authorize the election of a bishop coadjutor, who would serve with the
           bishop for a maximum of three years, then become bishop.
        </p>
        <p>Bishop Smith said it may take 18 months to install a bishop coadjutor, beginning with a meeting of  
          all the deans plus the standing committee. Our own rector, the Very Rev. Thomas Thoeni, is one of the seven deans in the 
          diocese, representing the Naples Deanery.
